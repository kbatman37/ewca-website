		<section><span class='c-and'>And</span> it came to pass in those days, that there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus that all <span class='c-the'>the</span> world should be taxed.</section>
		<section>(<span class='c-and'>And</span> this taxing was first made when Cyrenius was governor of Syria.)</section>
		<section><span class='c-and'>And</span> all went to be taxed, every one into his own city.</section>
		<section><span class='c-and'>And</span> Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of <span class='c-the'>the</span> city of Nazareth, into Judaea, unto <span class='c-the'>the</span> city of David, which is called Bethlehem; (because he as of <span class='c-the'>the</span> house <span class='c-and'>and</span> lineage of David:)</section>
		<section>To be taxed with Mary his espoused wife, being great with child.</section>
		<section><span class='c-and'>And</span> so it was, that, while they were there, <span class='c-the'>the</span> days were accomplished that she should be delivered.</section>
		<section><span class='c-and'>And</span> she brought forth her firstborn son, <span class='c-and'>and</span> wrapped him in swaddling clothes, <span class='c-and'>and</span> laid him in a manger; because there was no room for them in he inn.</section>
		<section><span class='c-and'>And</span> there were in <span class='c-the'>the</span> same country shepherds abiding in <span class='c-the'>the</span> field, keeping watch over their flock by night.</section>
		<section><span class='c-and'>And</span>, lo, <span class='c-the'>the</span> angel of <span class='c-the'>the</span> Lord came upon them, <span class='c-and'>and</span> <span class='c-the'>the</span> glory of <span class='c-the'>the</span> Lord shone round about them: <span class='c-and'>and</span> they were sore afraid.</section>
		<section><span class='c-and'>And</span> <span class='c-the'>the</span> angel said unto them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people.</section>
		<section>For unto you is born this day in <span class='c-the'>the</span> city of David a Saviour, which is <span class='c-christ'>Christ</span> <span class='c-the'>the</span> Lord.</section>
		<section><span class='c-and'>And</span> this shall be a sign unto you; Ye shall find <span class='c-the'>the</span> babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger.</section>
		<section><span class='c-and'>And</span> suddenly there was with <span class='c-the'>the</span> angel a multitude of <span class='c-the'>the</span> heavenly host praising God, <span class='c-and'>and</span> saying,</section>
		<section>Glory to God in <span class='c-the'>the</span> highest, <span class='c-and'>and</span> on earth peace, good will toward men.</section>
		<section><span class='c-and'>And</span> it came to pass, as <span class='c-the'>the</span> angels were gone away from them into heaven, <span class='c-the'>the</span> shepherds said one to another, Let us now go even unto Bethlehem, nd see this thing which is come to pass, which <span class='c-the'>the</span> Lord hath made known unto us.</section>
		<section><span class='c-and'>And</span> they came with haste, <span class='c-and'>and</span> found Mary, <span class='c-and'>and</span> Joseph, <span class='c-and'>and</span> <span class='c-the'>the</span> babe lying in a manger.</section>
		<section><span class='c-and'>And</span> when they had seen it, they made known abroad <span class='c-the'>the</span> saying which was told them concerning this child.</section>
		<section><span class='c-and'>And</span> all they that heard it wondered at those things which were told them by <span class='c-the'>the</span> shepherds.</section>
		<section>But Mary kept all these things, <span class='c-and'>and</span> pondered them in her heart.</section>
		<section><span class='c-and'>And</span> <span class='c-the'>the</span> shepherds returned, glorifying <span class='c-and'>and</span> praising God for all <span class='c-the'>the</span> things that they had heard <span class='c-and'>and</span> seen, as it was told unto them.</section>
